#### DO & DON'T

**DO:**

- **Professional** email address
- Subject line = **Clear & Brief**
- Words of **Appreciation**
- Consider **Culture**

**DON'T:**

- Don't make mistakes:
  - Spelling
  - Grammar
  - Punctuation
  - Capitalization
- Don't write long emails
- Don't complain or blame
- Don't send until Checked

#### Organization, Style & Editing Basics

The best way to be **BRIEF**:

- Use your OWN WORDS
- Use your OWN MESSAGE
- Say ONLY what is needed

**Compared:** 

:) We often add adjectives and adverbs and filler words which are not necessary.  

:( Very often when we write, we put lots of extra words, like adjectives and adverbs, which, when you really think about it, are very much unnecessary. 

**DO:**

- Focus on PRECISION

**DON'T:**

- Don't use PASSIVE voice (NOT PASSIVE, but PRECISE!) 

  e.g.

  :( Powerful emails are written by people.

  :) People write powerful emails.

- Words to avoid: must / should / demand / require / necessity

#### in  Capitalization

If you don't capitalize ...

1. You may offend your readers

**Rule #1**

Use a capital letter at the beginning of every sentence. Also, use it after you end with a period.

**Rule #2**

  Adjectives: French wine / Italian sports cars / Colombian coffee

**Rule #3**

- PEOPLE & TITLES

When the word is the job, not the person's title, no capitalization

​	The president will travel to California.
​	coach Ellis
​	team owner Malcom Glazer	

**Rule #4**

DON'T capitalize prepositions  e.g. Lord of the Rings

*Exception: Capitalize prepositions at the beginning of the title

## Culture Matters

### High/Low Context Communication

**A BRAZILIAN  TO AN AMERICAN:**

>Hello Rachel,  
> <br>
>How have you been? The holidays are upon us again and so my vacation in January. I've got 30 days, so I've been considering to go to Europe or North America. I haven't been overseas yet. My trip would be 50％ for tourism and 50 ％ for studies. I wanted to do a crash course to get certificate for EFL teaching. Can you tell me where I can find one? I am also interested in ESP. For the USA I was considering this itinerary: Brazil to Miami to Orlando to Jacksonville to Savannah to Washington D.C. to New York City. To New York City to Atlanta, GA, New Orleans to LOS Angeles, Texas, San Francisco，Miami，and then finally Brazil. So what is your opinion? I'm so confused. I don't have a lot of money and so I'm afraid Of traveling in bad weather. Europe or USA?  
><br>
>Best,  
Rodrigo 

**AN AMERICAN  TO A KOREAN:** 

>Hey Chung,  
><br>
>How are you doing? I wanted to touch base with you about  the meeting we had last week. You mentioned your boss might be interested in purchasing our new product, and I wanted to know if you talked with him a bout it. Let me know the latest news.  
><br>
>Talk to you soon, 
Sally

### Age & Gender Considerations
