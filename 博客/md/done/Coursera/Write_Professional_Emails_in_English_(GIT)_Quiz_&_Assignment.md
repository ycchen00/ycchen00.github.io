### Assignment
Do you remember the introduction you wrote in Module 1? It is now time to look at that email again and revise it based on what you have learned in this course so far. The word revise means to reread your email and improve it. In other words, you want to make appropriate changes to your email to make it your best introduction email. 
So for this assignment, you have two options:
Option 1: Revise original email
Write a new and improved version of your introduction email.
Option 2: Write a new email
If you do not need to revise your original email, write an email to introduce two people to each other. For example, you can introduce two colleagues to each other. Or maybe you want to introduce somebody for a job opening at your company. 
Whichever option you choose, here are the parts of the email you need to have:
	1. Subject line
	2. Greeting
	3. At least 1 paragraph for your email text (3-4 sentences)
	4. Closing
Review criteria
After reading your introduction email a few times, look at each part of the email. Which parts are appropriate for a professional introduction email? Is punctuation correctly used? Is capitalization correctly applied? When you are completing each part, think about the following points: 
	? Subject line: clear purpose, brief (50 characters or less)
	? Greeting: formal, appropriate reader
	? Email Text: introduction-development-conclusion, 3-4 sentences/paragraph
	? Closing: simple, full name
By the end of the assignment, you should have a clearer and more professional introduction email. Good luck!

Martina has a business partner named Carl in England. In her last email to Carl, Martina asked for the signatures of Carl’s bosses so that she could finalize their business deal. However, Martina forgot to attach the documents that needed to be signed to her email message. One of the main issues is that the deadline for the deal is coming soon, so she needs to write a request/apology email to Carl as soon as possible.

	? A request for Carl to explain the situation to his superiors
	? A request for Carl to send the signatures as soon as possible. 
Language Use
	? Accurate punctuation throughout the paragraph
	? Accurate capitalization throughout the paragraph
	? Polite language use throughout the paragraph
Your email text for Martina Silva's email will be reviewed by 3 other members in this course. You will also get the opportunity to see how have written their paragraphs and give them feedback as well.
